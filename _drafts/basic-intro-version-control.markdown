Version control is a super complicated and disgustingly convolted tool for managing files. Why should you care? Because it also happens to be one of the *best* and most useful tools ever created.

I love version control, it saves me so many headaches every day. Very few things that I work with every day aren’t version controlled. [This blog is](https://github.com/tjacobdesign/tjacobdesign.github.io), for example. 

There are a number of super-great upsides to version control, and a number of downsides. One downside is that all of my *mistakes* are recorded, it isn’t just my huge successes that people can see. Absolutely every change I make, no matter how small, is catalogued for history.

But hold on, let me back up a bit and tell you a bit more about version control. What makes it so complicated? Why is it so important?

## Digging into files

File systems are the scourge of our time. Seriously, no one liked them when they were manilla envelopes. Why do we keep this system when no one has every liked using them?

The old file system paradigm does have a couple of advantages though. First of all, it’s familiar. And through that familiarity, it’s easy. File systems also work well when you only have a few files to store, they’re easy to access, quick to get in and out.

Version controlled file systems certainly do *not* make it faster to get in and out. But version control takes file systems to a whole new level, and achieves things that the lowly manila envelope can only dream of doing.

Here’s how it works. You start with a folder:
