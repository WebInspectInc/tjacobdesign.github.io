Version control is a better way to manage files. Anyone who works with computers can understand the frustration of keeping everything organized. Most file systems have files that look something like this:

* SomeFile.rtf
* SomeFile2.rtf
* SomeFile-final.rtf
* SomeFile-reallyfinal.rtf

The above is, in essence, a version control system. A very crude and rudementary one, but a version control system nonetheless.

Version control saves you from yourself. Instead of those four files, you get one file, called `SomeFile.rtf` (or whatever you want). Then every time you change that file, the system picks up on it, and stores just the changes. If you want to go back in time on that file, you can, and that’s the power of version control. 

Let me give you an example: [this blog is on GitHub](https://github.com/tjacobdesign/tjacobdesign.github.io), and you can see all of the changes I’ve ever made [on this very blogpost](https://github.com/tjacobdesign/tjacobdesign.github.io/commits/master/_drafts/basic-intro-version-control.markdown). Go ahead and go click around, you won’t hurt anything.

Pretty cool, huh? I can erase anything in the blogpost, make gross spelling errors, destroy the English language with my gross spelling errors, and all I have to do to fix it is go back one version.

## Why do we need version control?

Files are *hard*. Tell you what, I work with both designers and developers on a daily basis, and they both have the same basic problems: time management and file management.

Time management is a whole other animal, but file management has a solution (or at least a band-aid fix): version control.

## How does it work?

Here’s the basic idea:

1. Create a file system, and initialize the version control system
2. Add any or all of your files to the system
3. Commit to them, and add a message to say what you changed
4. Repeat process as necessary

Seems simple, right?
