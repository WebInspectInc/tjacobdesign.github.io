There are a lot of misconceptions out there about programming. When most people think about hard things, their lists are usually something like this (in order of difficulty):

* Ride a bull - fairly difficult
* Jump off a plane - quite difficult
* Wrestle a lion - super hard
* Write a computer program - impossible

We programmers just lean back, chuckle at their naiveté, and sip our expensive coffees that their fears bought us.

Maybe it’s just human nature, or maybe something different, but it seems like everyone has a list like this. Programmer or otherwise, everyone has a list of things they’re afraid to try.
