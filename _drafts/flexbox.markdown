This is a post about Flexbox. Flexbox is the thing that unicorns and rainbows are made of, it’s wonderful.

Responsive design has been around for a while now. It’s been more than a few years since [Ethan’s groundbreaking article](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) on the topic, and since then it’s done nothing but grow. There’s plenty of debate around this topic, but I think it’s safe to assume that [over 10% of top websites are now responsive](http://www.guypo.com/mobile/roughly-1-in-8-websites-is-responsive/).

And hey friend, in case you don’t know, that’s a *big stinking deal*. Four years ago the web on a small screen was awful. Today it’s 10% less awful.

It gets better too. Not only are 10% of websites responsive, but plenty of places now have dedicated mobile sites. And it’s easier than ever to add one to your site (I don’t recommend this approach, but out-of-the-box mobile sites are *usually* better than nothing).

Tools are improving as well.
