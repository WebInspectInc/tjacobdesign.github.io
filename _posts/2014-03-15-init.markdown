Let us start with what you are not:

This is not a site for the hardcore programmer. Those who know the quirks of C++, for example. Or if you take pride in knowing 47 different programming languages. That’s great, rock on! But this site is probably not for you.

Nor is this site for the hardcore designer. If you’ve got Photoshop chops like no other then *I* should be the one learning from *you*. If you gobble gorgeous sites like toast for breakfast, then you probably aren’t going to need what I’m going to teach.

These words are for the generalist.
