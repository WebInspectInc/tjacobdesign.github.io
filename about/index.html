      <h1>A web devigner and full-stack FRED</h1>
      <p>My name is Timothy. I currently work at an incredible company called <a href="http://firespring.com">Firespring</a>. I'm a Front-End Developer (FRED) and designer from the great state of Nebraska.</p>
      <p>I build great websites. But more importantly, I ship. Even if I haven't <em>quite</em> polished enough (hint).</p>
      <p>This blog and all words (typos and all) are <a href="https://github.com/tjacobdesign/foradesigner">free and open source</a>. Use them.</p>
